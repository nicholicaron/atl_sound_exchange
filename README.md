# ATL Sound Exchange -- Proof of Concept #

### What if you could invest in a product that you know better than anyone? ###
---------------------

The idea is to build an **open-sourced record label that functions as Stock Market**. The market would display an artists popularity by charting streaming data and calculating a _share price (i.e. partial ownership in a record deal)_ and _dividends (i.e. royalties)_. Thus allowing day-one fans to act as **A&R**'s and putting their money where their mouth is. 

**A musical artist is a business**. They require startup capital and distribution, they benefit from network economies, counter-positioning, and branding. There is also a strong opportunity for a derivatives market.

For the proof of concept we will create a simulation of this market by scraping an artists streaming data and allowing users to perform paper trading (trading with fake money). 

* Why would it be appealing?
    - For investors: 
        + Invest in lucrative businesses that issue regular dividends that they truly know and have a feel for, rather than trying to speculate on markets which they are unfamiliar with.
        + Return on investment for the day 1 fans 
    - For artists: 
        + Transparent contracts, much more control over terms 
        + Clear route to buying back their masters 
        + Deal with people that love them rather than cold, calculating label execs
        + Highly distributed distribution network
    - Strong network effects
    - First mover advantage
    - Brand recognition
    - Take power away from predatory and exploitative record industry, give it to the fans



<blockquote>     "The problem of collective action is a variant of the prisoners' dilemma, albeit one with many more than two prisoners... How can unpopular tyrants control large populations for long periods [when] a simultaneous move by the masses stands a very good chance of success.
But the communication and coordination required for such action is difficult, and the oppresors, knowing the power of the masses, take special steps to keep it difficult. When the people must act individually and hope that the momentum will build up, the question arises, 'Who is going to be the first?'" </blockquote>
