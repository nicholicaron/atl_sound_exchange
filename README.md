# ATL Sound Exchange -- Proof of Concept #

### What if you could invest in a product that you know better than anyone? ###
---------------------

The idea is to build an **crowd-funded record label that functions as Stock Market**. Instead of businesses, the stock market would market musical artists by charting streaming data and calculating a _share price (i.e. partial ownership in a record deal)_ and _dividends (i.e. royalties)_. Thus allowing day-one fans to act as **A&R**'s and put their money where their mouth is. 

**A musical artist is a business**. They require startup capital and distribution, they benefit from network economies, counter-positioning, and branding. There is also a strong opportunity for a derivatives market.

For the proof of concept we will create a simulation of this market by scraping an artists streaming data and allowing users to perform paper trading (trading with fake money). 

* Why would it be appealing?
    - For investors: 
        + Invest in lucrative businesses that issue regular dividends that they truly know and have a feel for, rather than trying to speculate on markets which they are unfamiliar with.
        + Return on investment for the day 1 fans 
    - For artists: 
        + Transparent contracts, much more control over terms 
        + Clear route to buying back their masters 
        + Deal with people that love them rather than cold, calculating label execs
        + Highly distributed distribution network
    - Strong network effects
    - First mover advantage
    - Brand recognition
    - Take power away from predatory and exploitative record industry, give it to the fans

* Musical artists are being screwed and extorted by record labels and their shady business practices

    - Record labels are companies that produce, distribute, and promote music and other audio recordings. While record labels can play a valuable role in helping artists to create and distribute their music, some artists have criticized the industry for exploitative practices that take advantage of musicians with unfair record deals.

    One common complaint is that record labels often offer musicians contracts with terms that are heavily weighted in favor of the label. These contracts can include provisions that allow the label to take a large percentage of an artist's earnings from record sales and other sources of income, such as touring and merchandise sales. Some contracts may also include terms that grant the label ownership of an artist's work, including the right to control the use and distribution of their music.

    Artists have also raised concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability within the record label industry, with some alleging that they have been denied access to financial records and have not received fair payment for their work. Some artists have also reported being subject to pressure from record labels to conform to certain image and branding requirements, or to produce music that is more commercial and less artistically authentic.

    Overall, while record labels can play a valuable role in helping artists to create and distribute their music, it is important for musicians to be aware of the potential for exploitation and to carefully review and negotiate the terms of any record deal to ensure that it is fair and equitable.

<blockquote>     "The problem of collective action is a variant of the prisoners' dilemma, albeit one with many more than two prisoners... How can unpopular tyrants control large populations for long periods [when] a simultaneous move by the masses stands a very good chance of success.
But the communication and coordination required for such action is difficult, and the oppresors, knowing the power of the masses, take special steps to keep it difficult. When the people must act individually and hope that the momentum will build up, the question arises, 'Who is going to be the first?'" </blockquote>
